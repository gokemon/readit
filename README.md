# readit
A MEAN-stack Reddit smacker news clone using JavaScript, NodeJS and MongoDB.
I figure lets make it HTML5 and CSS3 compliant, and with as much RWB handling as I can design in. I should try to build as a accessible as I can think to while working on it, but with CRUD ops and such as my main goal, I don't know how accessible it will be. I guess I could go an agile reiteration and work on that later. 


Below is a basic list of things I want the users to be able to do:

- Create new posts
- View all posts ordered by UpVotes
- Add comments about a given post
- View comments for a given post
- UpVote posts and comments

In addition to technologies that make up MEAN, I'm going to use several other libraries to help me achieve with my goals:

- Mongoose.js for adding structure to MongoDB
- Angular ui-router for client-side routing
- Bootstrap for some basic styling
